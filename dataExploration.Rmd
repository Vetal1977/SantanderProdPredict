# Introduction
Here I will explore the data provided by Santander for their Kaggle competition 
'Santander Product Recommendation'. We have two files with train and test data from 
them: 'train_ver2.csv' and 'test_ver2.csv'.

# Train data
``` {r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide', cache = TRUE}
library(data.table)

selectRow <- c('ncodpers', 'fecha_dato',
               'ind_empleado', 'pais_residencia', 'sexo', 'age', 
               'fecha_alta', 'ind_nuevo', 'antiguedad', 'indrel',
               'ult_fec_cli_1t', 'indrel_1mes', 'tiprel_1mes', 'conyuemp',
               'canal_entrada', 'ind_actividad_cliente', 'renta')

# read the train data from the file
train <- fread('train_ver2.csv', sep = ',', na.strings = "NA", 
               stringsAsFactors = FALSE, select = selectRow)
```

## Remove suspicious NA's
After train data load and checking their summary ...
``` {r echo = FALSE}
# summary
summary(train)
```
... we see that there are exactly `r nrow(train[is.na(train$age)])` rows with NA's in some
important columns (age, customer seniority, activity index and some others).  
If we take a closer look to a couple of such records ...
``` {r echo = FALSE}
head(train[is.na(train$age)], 2)
tail(train[is.na(train$age)], 2)
```
... then we see that all other fields except the date and customer code are empty.
So we can remove them from the training set.
``` {r echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
train <- train[!is.na(train$age)]
```

## Residence country and age
Let's have a look to the customer's residence country ...
``` {r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(rworldmap)

country <- train[, .N, by = pais_residencia]
plotData <- joinCountryData2Map(dF = country, joinCode = "ISO2", 
                                nameJoinColumn = "pais_residencia", verbose=F)
mapCountryData(mapToPlot = plotData, nameColumnToPlot = "N", catMethod = "logFixedWidth",
                 oceanCol = "steelblue1",missingCountryCol = "white",
                 mapTitle = "Customers by country",
                 aspect = "variable")
```
... the most customers are coming from Spain. We will narrow down the data using the age 
limitations for Spain; this means, from 18 (age when any may open a bank account) to 
83 (life expectation). To be a bit more sure, I say that the valid age interval is from 18 to 90. 
For other ages I set a median value.

``` {r echo = FALSE}
train <- train[train$age >= 18 & train$age <= 83]
```

## Income
There are `r nrow(train[is.na(train$renta)])` rows where income is not available.
It is not possible to use decision trees to determine missing incomes since the rows
have new labels (country codes, some dates, etc.). For random forest it is necessary 
to have no NA's. So we take the median.

``` {r echo = FALSE}
train[is.na(train$renta)]$renta <- median(train[!is.na(train$renta)]$renta)
```
